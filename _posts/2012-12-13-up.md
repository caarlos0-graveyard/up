Up is a clean and beautiful [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) based layout
for [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was
based on [zachholman's](http://zachholman.com/) blog themes: the "old" one, now
opensourced as [left](http://github.com/holman/left), and also in his actual
theme, that's not opensource (I believe), but I steal some ideas anyway. I also
took something from [jekyll-bootstrap](https://github.com/plusjade/jekyll-bootstrap),
and, of course, I'm using [bootstrap](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap) as
a base for all the thing.

## Installation

- Install Jekyll: `gem install jekyll`
- Fork this repository
- Rename it to `YOUR-USER.github.com`
- Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER/YOUR-USER.github.com`
- Run the jekyll server in the blog folder: `rake preview`.

You should have a server up and running locally at <http://localhost:4000>.

## Customization

Next you'll want to change a few things. The list of files you may want to
change is the following:

- [_config.yml](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/master/_config.xml): Put
your config there, almost everything will be up and running.
- [about.yml](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/master/about.html): Well, that's
about you, I'll gonna change it if I am you... OH WAIT!
- [CNAME](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/master/CNAME): If you're using
  this on GitHub Pages with a custom domain name, you'll want to change this
  to be the domain you're going to use. All that should be in here is a
  domain name on the first line and nothing else (like: `example.com`).
- [favicon.ico](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/master/favicon.ico): This
  is a smaller version of my gravatar for use as the icon in your browser's
  address bar. You should change it to whatever you'd like.
- [apple-touch-icon.png](https://github.com/caarlos0/up/blob/master/apple-touch-icon.png):
  Again, this is my gravatar, and it shows up in iOS and various other apps
  that use this file as an "icon" for your site.


## Deployment

You should deploy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com)- it's just
easier.

All you should have to do is rename your repository on GitHub to be
`username.github.com`. Since everything is on the `gh-pages` branch, you
should be able to see your new site at <http://username.github.com>.
