Finally made it out to the [Columbus.rb](http://columbusrb.com) Code Jam, a monthly meetup of Ruby hackers focused on coding as opposed to watching presentations. It was hosted by the good folks at [2Checkout](http://2checkout.com) who provided space and food, which was super-awesome of them. Ironically, not a lot of hardcode coding got done but it's a fun time with fun folks, and I definitely learned a bit. Highly recommended!
