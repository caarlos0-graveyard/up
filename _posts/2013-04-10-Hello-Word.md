Hello I'm Lucas Merencia, I work as developer at TOTVS.

A few days ago I saw that merencia.com domain was available, so I thought "no more!" and got it for me =D.

I don't knew what do with my new domain, then talking with my friends I decided follow my friend Carlos and create a blog...

Creating this blog I learned a very interesting thing, github pages is so fantastic!

I using Jekyll with [UP](https://github.com/caarlos0/up) a [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) based layout. A don't know exactly what I will post on my blog, but I wanna it be useful, for me as documenting what I learn, and for other that may use this for something...

Well, I think is it for now. Have a nice day!
