Recently I've been working on an EmberJS application (http://gohiring.com) which
needs to allow file uploads. There are a couple of different approaches to this
which I'll discuss here, along with a new one which I would like to propose.


## HTML5 FileReader API

## JQuery Ajax Upload

## Ember Data FormData Adapter

This is the approach that I have settled on.
