title: 'Review: Kinesis Freestyle Keyboard'
---

I've been using my new Kinesis Freestyle keyboard all this afternoon. 

Check out my [Flickr set](http://www.flickr.com/photos/jcanady/sets/72157623032263907/) for some pictures of it in action, as well as some closeups of the issues I'll mention below.

## Long Story Short

I can get past the few slight issues, and I love it.

## First Impressions

I'm no keyboard connoisseur, but I know what I like, and I like the switches on the Freestyle. The keys have just enough travel and resistance to suit my tastes. They feel good, and make a pleasing sound. I don't think they're mechanical switches, but I can live with that.

## The Top Function Keys

The top row of F-keys doubles as your standard Mac modifier keys, using a layout very similar to current Apple models.  They've added a button that toggles Dock auto-hiding, which is neat if not useful, and a power button.

I normally hate function-keys-cum-media-keys -- I like to be able to adjust my volume, play my media, *and* hit function keys when I need them, without using a modifier key. Kinesis thought of me when making this keyboard: the fn key (which toggles between F1-F12 and Apple shortcut keys) isn't a modifier, it's a mode-switcher (like caps lock). When I'm in need of full F1-F12 love, I hit that key and I've got it. Otherwise, I leave it off and have my media keys and so on. I can't say how much I appreciate that.

## The Driverless Hotkeys

There are some hotkeys on the left-hand side which appear to be hardware macros. Internet back/forward, beginning/end of line, cut, copy, paste, undo, select all, and the aforementioned "fn" key.

I can't see becoming dependent on them, but they're handy if you remember to use
them.

## Gotchas

If you're coming from a regular Ergonomic keyboard (I previously used the Microsoft Natural Elite 4000), the location of the left command key is weird: it's positioned (below) halfway between "x" and "z" instead of directly under "x". I constantly miss it.

Same with the right Shift key: there's padding between it and the up-arrow, and I sometimes shove my finger there instead of hitting the Shift.

Since it's a compact keyboard, you don't get the pageup/pagedown/home/end/insert/delete block. There's no insert key (which is fine), delete is above the backspace key (and just as wide), and the other four keys are vertically aligned on the right-hand side of the keyboard.  Not the best layout, but given the constraints, not the worst.

## The Last Word

I've got mine at the Innova office right now, and I'm strongly considering buying one for home.
