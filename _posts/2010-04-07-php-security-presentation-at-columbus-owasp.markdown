title: PHP Security Presentation at Columbus OWASP
---

On March 23 I gave an hour-long presentation at the Columbus OWASP on PHP security. It went through the <a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2007">OWASP Top Ten</a>, described each vulnerability, showed some vulnerable code, and explained the fix.

It's <a href="http://www.innova-partners.com/blog/2010/03/23/php-security-presentation/">available</a> on the <a href="http://innova-partners.com">Innova Partners</a> blog, who employed me and sponsored the meeting. Thanks again, Innova!
