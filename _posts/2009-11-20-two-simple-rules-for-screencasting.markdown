During the process of trying to figure out what [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) is, I tried to watch the official Compass [screencast](http://wiki.github.com/chriseppstein/compass). This was a mistake. Thinking of writing an introductory screencast for your product? Learn from their mistakes.

### Keep It Short

No shit, the Compass screencast is *an hour long.*  The only people who are going to watch that are people with a vested interest in the project, who presumably already know the material.

Keep your screencasts to around five minutes. You aren't  [PeepCode](http://peepcode.com/), and this thing isn't your documentation. If you can't keep a basic explanation of your product/service down to five minutes, you have bigger problems.

### Show, Don't Tell

Up until about 2:20, the Compass screencast doesn't even change, and it takes another minute before there's any actual content on the screen. If the viewer wanted to read a thorough explanation of your product, they would have read the "about" page. 

Start with a brief intro on what your product is, then jump right into the demonstration. Impress the viewer quickly and keep them impressed.

### It's That Simple

That's all you need for an effective screencast. It's almost a definition: "short" and "demonstration". It's hard to go wrong.
