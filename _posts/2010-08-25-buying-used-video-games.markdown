## When did crippling products become acceptable?

Those aren't the same things *at all.*

## Shit, my copy of Fallout 3 rusted.

In the used car and book example, you're buying a *used physical product* which (may)
suffer from wear and tear during usage. You adjust your price based on
how much different the item is from the unused new item.

In the used video game case, you're really buying two things:

1. The physical medium the game code is stored on, which usually also
suffers from some physical wear, like scratches, missing manuals,
etc. 
2. The game executables, which do not suffer from
wear.

Look, programmers joke about "[bit
rot](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rot)", but in reality video game code
doesn't wear down with use. The executables don't become any less
executable. Left on its own, that game will run just fine for the
first, second, and 100<sup>th</sup> owner without fail.

Unless you *build artificial wear into your products,* which makes you
scum. If your product is engineered to fail, you're selling shoddy
merchandise, full stop.
