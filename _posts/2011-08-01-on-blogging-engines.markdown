My personal blog is now powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org/), which is a nice packaged version of [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll). I find that I love Jekyll's hackability but that I don't always want to hack on my blogging engine to get it to do something new. Octopress comes with a great set of default plugins for most of the things I wanted to do, with a default theme I can stand.
