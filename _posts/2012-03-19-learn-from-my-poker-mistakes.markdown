Played in a cash game at [The Bicycle Club](http://thecycleclub.org).  Bought in
to $1/$1 for $100, sat down. Had some good hands, had some bad hands, made some
minor mistakes but kept my head and ground out some steady profit.

Let me paint a word picture:

I only have one hour left at the table. Self-imposed time limit.

For the entirety of this hour, I can't catch a hand. Either it's way below my
range, or it's right in the middle of my range but the flop completely avoids
me. I'm playing well, I even manage to bluff a few tiny pots and keep my stack
steady.

Five minutes to go. Can't go wrong now. Gonna stay through the blinds, play the
button, and bow out.

I'm in the big blind. Get dealt crap, other players raise, I'm out.

I'm in the small blind. It's this, and one more hand, and I'm cashing my chips in.
Someone raises to $12. I look down at QQ. I don't know if I hid the shock on my
face at seeing a good hand. I raise to $25. Dude thinks for two seconds and
calls.

Flop comes. J 7 3, rainbow. I look down at my cards again. I think for a second.

And then I *open fucking shove.* With no action before me and only one other
player in the hand, I bet the entire nut.

Kids, never take my advice. I'm horrible at poker.

My opponent calls. I know exactly what's happened. I table QQ, he tables AA. Of
course I can't catch a two-outer, and in this case I deserve my loss.

Now, it's extremely likely that the money was getting in the pot anyway. When
the board was run out, There was no K or A in sight. I had a devestating
overpair and probably would have raised whatever he'd bet. But that doesn't
excuse my play. I can't say I played it well but luck simply got the best of me.
I played it horribly and fate raked my face.

*sigh* And I missed [Columbus Ruby Brigade](http://columbusrb.com) for this.
