title: HTML 5 Video Annoying, Usable Today
---

[Gruber](http://daringfireball.com) [suggests](http://daringfireball.net/2009/12/html5_video_unusable) that HTML 5 video is "effectively unusable" for the following two reasons:

1. It doesn't allow poster images.
2. Both audio and video always auto-buffer instead of waiting for a click.

Our hero gets past the first issue with some Javascript hackery, which also fixes the second issue.  So, completely usable before (with a few issues), 100% usable afterwards.

There is the ever-present IE issue -- no version of Internet Explorer as of this writing supports `<video>` or `<audio>` -- but this isn't at all an issue for Gruber.  
	
The effective conclusion to Gruber's "effectively unusable" piece is "I used it for my [PastryKit video page](http://daringfireball.net/misc/2009/12/user_guide_demos) but I had to use Javascript and create two versions of each video and I don't like that."

Which seems, y'know, *usable* to me.
