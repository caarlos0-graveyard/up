So I decided to release a new [UP][1] version. Changes include:

- Bootstrap 3.0.0;
- Last Font-Awesome version;
- Improved Makefile and Rakefile;
- Pygments for syntax highlight;
- Bootstrap collapse plugin (navbar is now fully responsive);
- Minor tweaks.

So, update it if you want! It shall be easy, since I was doing it in my
blog, and then import it back to [UP][1]. If you have any issues, you can
ping me at twitter or other social network, or even email me.

The general update guide is:

- Read the [readme][2];
- Replace `Rakefile` and `makefile` with the new ones;
- Copy the `package.json`;
- replace `_assets` folder;
- check the differences in default layout and apply it.

The whole list of differences can be found [here][3].

Hope you like this new version!
