I'll be giving a quick ten minute Intro To Tmux talk at the next [Columbus Ruby Brigade](http://columbusrb.com) meeting (new site, check it out!) on October 17. If you spend a lot of time inside a terminal it'll be ten minutes well spent. The meeting also features a Knockout.js overview by Alex Bartlow, a talk about the ReUser gem by its author, Isaac Sanders, and a talk entitled "The Art of Brewing" (beer, not the package manager) by Matt Darby. 

This _absolutely_ counts as a post about software. See, I don't just have a blog about poker.
