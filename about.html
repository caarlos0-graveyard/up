  <p>
    Carlos works at <a href="https://totvs.com.br">TOTVS S/A</a>. When he's not
    doing that, he's <a href="http://caarlos0.github.com">blogging</a>,
    hacking on <a href="https://github.com/caarlos0">open source</a>,
    building new products (like <a href="http://wealcash.com">Wealcash</a>)
    and learning new things. He has proficiency in Java and Ruby (preffer Ruby,
    of course), but also knew something about python, haskell and erlang. He is
    married with this beutiful girl in the photo and lives with her in Joinville
    (Santa Catarina - Brazil).

    Carlos used to have a pretty, bad-ass and eye-candy bloated curriculum here,
    but, well, there is so much places to update. So, check his
