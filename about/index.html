  <p>
  Originally from London, UK, Matt has lived in South of France, Barcelona and
  for the last 5 years settled in Berlin.
  Matt is currently working on a secret new startup. When he's not
  doing that, he's <a href="http://mattbeedle.name">blogging</a>,
  hacking on <a href="https://github.com/mattbeedle">open source</a>,
  building new products (like <a href="http://vegan.io">Vegan.io</a>)
  and learning new things. He has proficiency in Java, PHP, Ruby and Javascript
  (Ruby and Javascript preferred of course, please don't ask him to do PHP!), but
  also has knowledge of C, Python, Io, Scala and Go. You can check out his open
  source report card <a href="http://osrc.dfm.io/mattbeedle">here</a>.
  His last successful startup was
  <a href="http://1000jobboersen.de">1000jobboersen.de</a> which reached 150+
  employees at one point and is still going now after he left.

    Matt used to have a pretty, bad-ass and eye-candy bloated curriculum here,
    but, well, there are too many places to update. So, check his
