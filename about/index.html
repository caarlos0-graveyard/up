  <p>
  Matt is currently working on a secret new startup. When he's not
  doing that, he's <a href="http://mattbeedle.name">blogging</a>,
  hacking on <a href="https://github.com/mattbeedle">open source</a>,
  building new products (like <a href="http://vegan.io">Vegan.io</a>)
  and learning new things. He has proficiency in Java, PHP, Ruby and Javascript
  (Ruby and Javascript preferred of course, please don't ask him to do PHP!), but
  also has knowledge of C, Python, Io, Scala and Go. His last successful startup was
  <a href="http://1000jobboersen.de">1000jobboersen.de</a> which reached 150+
  employees at one point and is still going now after he left. Originally from
  London, UK, Matt is has lived in the South of France, Barcelona, and for the
  last 5 years settled in Berlin.

    Matt used to have a pretty, bad-ass and eye-candy bloated curriculum here,
    but, well, there is so much places to update. So, check his
